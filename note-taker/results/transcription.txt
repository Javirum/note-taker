[00:01] Oh, going to Cuba. I went to Cuba on Prohibition time, too, and I bought a lot of fancy bottles,
[00:14] like one drink in for souvenirs for all my friends.
[00:19] Well, Atlantic City, the ship was stopped. It was all in the newspapers about it, too.
[00:26] The crew had ripped the walls and put all liquor in the walls.
[00:32] So we all had to get up at three o'clock in the morning.
[00:36] And, oh, it was a scream. The men were coming down their pajamas and bathrobes,
[00:42] and they had bottles sticking all out all over, and anyone could see they had the bottles.
[00:48] And, oh, the captain says, get rid of that stuff.
[00:52] They're searching the boats. They're downstairs ripping the wall apart.
[00:57] So...
[01:01] They looked us all over for liquor and for bringing things in from Cuba.
[01:11] And the girl in front of me, she had a bottle she was bringing in from her mother-in-law,
[01:16] and they found that bottle in her bag.
[01:20] So they found her $50 and threw it over the side of the boat.
[01:26] So then I got panicky.
[01:31] I had about six little bottles, and I thought,
[01:35] I'll have to stay on boat and wash the dishes.
[01:38] I spent all my money down there.
[01:40] I was coming home broke.
[01:43] So the doctors are not allowed to touch the women.
[01:47] They send you down to the matron.
[01:50] So when he went to examine me,
[01:53] he said,
[01:56] you're a very sick woman, you better go down to the matron.
[02:00] I was so nervous and upset that my pulse was going so fast. And I couldn't talk. And I was holding my coat around my stomach, see, so they wouldn't...
[02:14] And I guess he thought I was pregnant, see, because the bottles all started to move to the front.
[02:23] So he says, oh, like a sick woman, you better go down to the matron. And all I kept thinking about was, oh, if they ever find those bottles, I'll have to stay on ship a month to pay up for it.
[02:35] If they find you $50 a bottle. I think I had eight. And I was broke because I'd been down there a month and I'd spent my money.
[02:50] And she didn't examine me. She said, what's the matter? Oh, I said, I'm so nervous. I said, don't worry.
[03:00] Those doctors, they're fooling around. I said, my friend in front, they threw the bottle overboard, and I got all nervous and upset.
[03:09] And she says, well, I'll give you a pill and you calm down.
[03:16] But I would never bring liquor in again after that. I wouldn't go through that again. For no souvenirs.
