1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Oh, going to Cuba. I went to Cuba on Prohibition time, too, and I bought a lot of fancy bottles,

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
like one drink in for souvenirs for all my friends.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Well, Atlantic City, the ship was stopped. It was all in the newspapers about it, too.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The crew had ripped the walls and put all liquor in the walls.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So we all had to get up at three o'clock in the morning.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And, oh, it was a scream. The men were coming down their pajamas and bathrobes,

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and they had bottles sticking all out all over, and anyone could see they had the bottles.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And, oh, the captain says, get rid of that stuff.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
They're searching the boats. They're downstairs ripping the wall apart.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So...

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:10,000
They looked us all over for liquor and for bringing things in from Cuba.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And the girl in front of me, she had a bottle she was bringing in from her mother-in-law,

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and they found that bottle in her bag.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So they found her $50 and threw it over the side of the boat.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So then I got panicky.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I had about six little bottles, and I thought,

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'll have to stay on boat and wash the dishes.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I spent all my money down there.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I was coming home broke.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So the doctors are not allowed to touch the women.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
They send you down to the matron.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So when he went to examine me,

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
he said,

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
you're a very sick woman, you better go down to the matron.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I was so nervous and upset that my pulse was going so fast. And I couldn't talk. And I was holding my coat around my stomach, see, so they wouldn't...

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And I guess he thought I was pregnant, see, because the bottles all started to move to the front.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So he says, oh, like a sick woman, you better go down to the matron. And all I kept thinking about was, oh, if they ever find those bottles, I'll have to stay on ship a month to pay up for it.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If they find you $50 a bottle. I think I had eight. And I was broke because I'd been down there a month and I'd spent my money.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And she didn't examine me. She said, what's the matter? Oh, I said, I'm so nervous. I said, don't worry.

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Those doctors, they're fooling around. I said, my friend in front, they threw the bottle overboard, and I got all nervous and upset.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And she says, well, I'll give you a pill and you calm down.

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But I would never bring liquor in again after that. I wouldn't go through that again. For no souvenirs.
